# PhonePe

Problem Statement: The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner. Results: The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner. The dashboard will have at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. The data will be stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and the dashboard will be dynamically updated to reflect the latest data. Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. The dashboard will provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making. Overall, the result of this project will be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository.

The aim of this project is to develop a solution that extracts, transforms, and visualizes data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves:

1.Data Extraction: Scripting to clone the repository and collect data.

2.Data Transformation: Using Python and Pandas to clean and structure the data.

3.Database Insertion: Storing transformed data in a POSTGRESQL database.

4.Dashboard Creation: Using Streamlit and Plotly to build an interactive dashboard.

5.Data Retrieval: Fetching data from the database to dynamically update the dashboard.
